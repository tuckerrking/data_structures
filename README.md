# data_structures
Header files of various data structures.

Most of these were written for my CS 372 - Data Structrues course
at the Athens State University. Where applicable, I've noted 
where code was pulled from class lectures.

Inlcudes the following data structures:
- Linked List
- Stack
- Bag

I will continue to update this repository as the semester continues.
